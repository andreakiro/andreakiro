# Memento dump

Currently doing ML research at MIT (CBMM), graduated from ETH Zurich and EPFL

— I am interested in theoretical ML research, RL, LLMs engineering and optimization
<br>— I sometimes contribute and open pull requests on large open source projects that I use
<br>— I also interned at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/labs/zurich), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Delimobil](https://delimobil.ru/) and contracted for [Audemars Piguet](https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/home.html)
<br>— I shoot analog pictures with an olympus mju i, love cinema, vinyls, and coffee

# Things built from scratch

\* i am probably missing a few other things

# Other things i've done

Been very active in student societies at every university I attended;
<br>— Presided [JE EPFL](https://je.epfl.ch/en) the largest swiss student consulting structure for a year
<br>with over 40 working members and 100ish rolling engineering projects anytime
<br>with customers ranging from SMBs to very large international corporations
<br>— Helped [TEDx](https://www.tedxecublens.com/), [Google student dev club](https://gdsc.community.dev/eth-zurich/) and [Entrepreneur club](https://www.entrepreneur-club.org/) for events org

— I founded and managed [copnrelax](https://www.instagram.com/copnrelax) with total of 8 persons working with/for me;
<br>organized popup shop events in Europe in Geneva Switzerland and Vienna Austria
<br>reaching 500+ visitors and a lot of sales at 17-18yo. This was cool.
